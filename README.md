# Time Series Forecasting Reliability

This repository contains applied case studies exploring why time series forecasting models fail in real-world deployments even when offline metrics look strong.

The focus is not on building more complex models but on understanding:
- forecast drift and retraining tradeoffs
- uncertainty and horizon-dependent errors
- regime shifts vs temporary anomalies
- why prediction accuracy alone is insufficient for decision-making

Each notebook isolates a specific failure mode or design choice commonly encountered in production forecasting systems.
